This very good Hotel to stay in Shirkazi, Dist. nagapattim, Chennai rooms start from Rs.500/- from non.ac and AC Started from Rs.700/- onward. Centrally located hotel. Ok type hotel. Staff is Good and well. Shirkazi is city of Temple and beach. Only some people know Hindi language.
Plain uncomplicated South India meal (sathvic) is the call , then this is a great place.Has good food. Run by a small family. Seems with focus on quality rather than money.Catering is also an option .Good place to reach out for any religious ceremony in the temple town.
After enjoying Sattanathaswamy Temple, visit this restaurant that is not far away. But a number of guests who use Google didn't grant Sampoorna Restaurant a high rating.
